- footer doesn't stay at bottom right when skills push screen down
- mobile can look wonky
- editing the number input fields can be annoying if not using mouse wheel/number arrows
- editing skill/armor datalists requires ENTER key press or un-focus to take effect.  probably annoying for some
- update TU2/TU3/TU4/TU5 armor images/urls when available on any good site I find (kiranico is a lost cause)
- update kiranicoURL on all new armor pieces (not used currently, so doesn't really matter)
